<p id="description">The Hidden Wiki was a dark web MediaWiki wiki operating as Tor hidden services that could be anonymously edited after registering on the site. The main page served as a directory of links to other .onion sites.</p>

  
  
<h2>History</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   The first Hidden Wiki was operated through the .onion pseudo top-level domain which can be accessed only by using Tor or a Tor gateway.\[1\] Its main page provided a community-maintained link directory to other hidden services including links claiming to offer money laundering contract killing cyber-attacks for hire contraband chemicals and bomb making. The rest of the wiki was essentially uncensored as well and also offered links to sites hosting child pornography and abuse images.\[2\] The earliest mention of the hidden wiki is from 2007 when it was located at 6sxoyfb3h2nvok2d.onion.\[3\] A well known iteration of the Hidden Wiki was founded some time before October 2011 coming to prominence with its associations with illegal content.\[4\] At some point prior to August 2013 the site was hosted on Freedom Hosting.\[5\] In March 2014 the site and its kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion domain was hacked and redirected to Doxbin.\[6\] Following this event the content began to be mirrored to more locations. During Operation Onymous in November 2014 after its Bulgarian hosting was compromised the site served a message from law enforcement.\[7\]

<h2>Successors</h2>

There are several .onion websites hosting successors based on mirrors of the Hidden Wiki; as such there is no longer one single official Hidden Wiki.\[7\] Many are hosted for accessibility reasons due to frequent downtime and instability of the main wiki while others were launched in order to filter links to child pornography.\[8\]
