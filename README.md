The Hidden Wiki was a dark web MediaWiki wiki operating as Tor hidden services that could be anonymously edited after registering on the site. The main page served as a directory of links to other .onion sites.

## History

The Hidden Wiki, operating through the .onion pseudo top-level domain accessible only via Tor or a Tor gateway, originated in 2007 at 6sxoyfb3h2nvok2d.onion. It provided a community-maintained link directory to various hidden services, including links to controversial content. Over time, it gained notoriety for its associations with illegal activities. In March 2014, the site and its domain were hacked, leading to a redirection to Doxbin. Following this incident, the content began to be mirrored to multiple locations. During Operation Onymous in November 2014, law enforcement took control of the site after its Bulgarian hosting was compromised.

## Successors

Several .onion websites now host successors based on mirrors of the Hidden Wiki. Due to frequent downtime and instability of the main wiki, some mirrors were launched for accessibility reasons, while others aim to filter links to inappropriate content.
