  The Hidden Wiki was a dark web MediaWiki operating as Tor hidden services, providing an anonymously editable link directory. 
</p>

<!-- History -->
## History

The Hidden Wiki, initially operating through the .onion pseudo top-level domain accessible only via Tor or a Tor gateway, served as a community-maintained link directory to various hidden services. Originating around 2007, it gained prominence for its associations with illegal content. Notably, in March 2014, the site was hacked, redirecting to Doxbin, and mirrored in multiple locations following Operation Onymous in November 2014.
