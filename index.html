  <h1>The Hidden Wiki</h1>

  <p>The Hidden Wiki was a dark web MediaWiki wiki operating as Tor hidden services that could be anonymously edited after registering on the site. The main page served as a directory of links to other .onion sites.</p>

  <h2>Origins and Purpose:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The Hidden Wiki was initially established as a dark web MediaWiki wiki.</li>
    <li>Its main purpose was to serve as a directory of links to other .onion sites, creating a decentralized and community-maintained platform.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Access and Anonymity:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The original Hidden Wiki and its successors operate through the .onion pseudo top-level domain.</li>
    <li>Accessing these sites typically requires the use of the Tor browser, which helps users maintain anonymity by routing their internet traffic through a series of volunteer-operated servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Content and Controversy:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The Hidden Wiki gained notoriety for hosting links to a wide range of content, some of which was controversial and illegal.</li>
    <li>Over time, it became associated with providing links to services related to illegal activities, such as drug trafficking, hacking, money laundering, and more.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>History:</h2>

  <p>The Hidden Wiki, operating through the .onion pseudo top-level domain accessible only via Tor or a Tor gateway, originated in 2007 at 6sxoyfb3h2nvok2d.onion. It provided a community-maintained link directory to various hidden services, including links to controversial content. Over time, it gained notoriety for its associations with illegal activities. In March 2014, the site and its domain were hacked, leading to a redirection to Doxbin. Following this incident, the content began to be mirrored to multiple locations. During Operation Onymous in November 2014, law enforcement took control of the site after its Bulgarian hosting was compromised.</p>

  <h3>Key Features:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Anonymously editable link directory.</li>
    <li>Initial operation through the .onion domain.</li>
    <li>Association with various hidden services.</li>
    <li>Mirroring and increased accessibility over time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Successors:</h2>

  <p>Several .onion websites now host successors based on mirrors of The Hidden Wiki. Due to frequent downtime and instability of the main wiki, some mirrors were launched for accessibility reasons, while others aim to filter links to inappropriate content.</p>
